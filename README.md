# Laplacian-CPU
This is a Visual Studio 2015 C++ OpenGL project which implements the morphological Laplacian operator on the CPU.  I created this CPU-only program before creating the GPU version, which is the LaplacianOperator repo.

This program uses the DevIL SDK, which is a cross-platform image library (http://openil.sourceforge.net).
